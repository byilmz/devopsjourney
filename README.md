# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Burak

## ðŸš§ Profile Under Renovation

I'm currently restructuring my GitHub profile to better reflect my current work as a Site Reliability Engineer. Many of my repositories contain older projects from my career transition, so I'm taking the time to:

- Clean up legacy code and documentation
- Reorganise projects by relevance and recency  
- Add proper documentation to current work
- Archive outdated personal experiments

## ðŸ”§ What I'm Working With

**Current Focus:** Infrastructure as Code, Kubernetes orchestration, and platform reliability

**Technologies:** AWS, Terraform/Terragrunt, Kubernetes, Docker, Python, Datadog

---

*This profile will be updated shortly with curated examples of my current work. Thanks for your patience!*
